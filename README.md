🧠 Machine Learning–Based Clinical Diabetes Prediction System

A Full-Stack Machine Learning Application for Clinical Risk Assessment

📌 Overview

The Clinical Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning–powered web application that predicts the risk of diabetes using real medical diagnostic features such as glucose level, BMI, age, insulin, and blood pressure.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, supervised model training, model serialization, REST-style API integration, and a deployment-ready web interface built using Flask. It highlights the practical application of AI in healthcare decision-support systems.

🎯 Objectives

Build a clinical risk prediction model using supervised machine learning

Apply data preprocessing, imputation, and feature scaling techniques

Deploy the trained model via a Flask-based web application

Provide probability-based predictions for interpretability

Demonstrate applied machine learning in a healthcare context

🚀 Key Capabilities

✔ End-to-end ML pipeline (data → model → deployment)
✔ Logistic Regression–based diabetes prediction
✔ Real-time prediction with probability output
✔ Clean and responsive web interface
✔ REST-style API endpoints
✔ Modular, maintainable, and extensible codebase

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
🧹 Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values using imputation

Feature scaling using standardization

Ensuring consistent preprocessing during training and inference

🤖 Model

Logistic Regression for binary classification

Probability-based output to represent risk level

💾 Model Persistence

Trained pipeline saved using Joblib

Enables reproducibility and efficient reuse

🔮 Prediction

User inputs are processed through the preprocessing pipeline

Model outputs:

Diabetes risk probability (%)

Classification (Diabetic / Non-Diabetic)

🧪 Example Predictions
